# Learn how to use React.js to build a Web App with RESTful service.

Hi, Welcome to my project.
Here, you will find example code to create a web app, using the following frameworks

* NodeJS as the server
* React Javascript library


Our Web app will call a simple REST service to manage data items

* create a simple object ( data item)
* list data items
* update a data item
* delete a data item

The REST service is another project.  The service is deployed here 
 [Live service](https://generic-db.glitch.me/).
